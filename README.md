# MDN Introduction to the DOM

## Learning Goals

- Explain the DOM
- Practice Reading Documentation

## Pre-check

In your head, you have some picture of what the DOM is, what it does, and what it is for. Let's check on some of those assumptions.

- How would you explain the DOM to someone who has programmed before, but is not familiar with it?
- How would you explain the DOM to someone who has never programmed before?
- What's the difference between the DOM and the javascript engine? What about between the DOM and the BOM?
- What are the key of the methods you use to interact with the DOM?

## Reading

Read [MDN's Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction). It should take you about 10 minutes.

## Post-check

Now that you've read the documentation introducing the DOM, take a minute to reflect.

- What's something you didn't know before you read the documentation?
- Who was the audience for this documentation? Which of your explanations (to programmers or non-programmers) did it match up to?
- What was difficult about reading this documentation?
- What would you change about your explanation of the DOM now?
- What changes would you make to this documentation? (psst! MDN has an edit button!)
